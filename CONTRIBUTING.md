### IDE

> IF you are using the modern IDE please configure it properly

1. VSCode
    1. Install the following plugins:
        * `ext install streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker` do not commit misspelled words or variables
        * `ext install Orta.vscode-jest` or `ext install WallabyJs.wallaby-vscode` we prefer TDD
        * `ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode` for codeStyle
        * `ext install shinnn.stylelint` for style linting
        * `ext install eg2.tslint` for typescript linting
        * `ext install asvetliakov.snapshot-tools` for checking the snapshot files before committing
1. PHPStorm/WebStorm
    1. Load settings from `config/jetBrains/settings.jar`

### Installation

We are using yarn so respect this. Just type `yarn` and you are ready to go

### Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the our change log**.

The commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI
wizard ([Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)). To use the wizard, run `yarn cm`
in your terminal after staging your changes in git.

A detailed explanation borrowed from angular and can be found in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#).

### Merge requests

1. Code should be formated using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
1. All tests should pass before pushing (respect git hooks)

After submitting a merge request you can access a feature demo website available at "deploy/netlify" by clicking on "Details" link
